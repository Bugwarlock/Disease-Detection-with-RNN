# Disease Detection with RNN
In this project, we trained a Hopefield neural network based on 1000 patient's record. The goal of this project was diagnose a disease with similar record with available patient's records. This project is done as a computer assignment of "Neural Networkds and Deep Learning (NNDL)" course. The report is in Persion but all the results are presented in English.
